# PythonLearning
This repository is going to be where I store all of my projects from the first "Hello World" and beyond throughout my Python learning process. 
I will personally use this Repo as a future reference for challenges I may have already solved but forgotten the solutions to. 
My goal here is to become proficient and maybe get a great job :)
